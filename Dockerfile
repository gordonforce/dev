# guest parameters as it has no external configuration dependencies: no volume

# Based on a recent stable alpine OS build with the sudoer stable jdk installed.
# Open JDK is the legal version for Docker. Also contains all of the
# development tools I expect to find at a minimum. I need to add these as meta
